                <p>
                    A dream come true, God gave me the opportunity to go to Mazatlan not only to build one but two houses where we could see the love of God and his provision for those people who needed a place to live, we built the houses for two women, one of them is a single mother who has a three year old daughter and the other one is a woman who lives alone, Both had been waiting for more than a year to have their own home and God allowed them to have it through two teams from the United States who raised funds so that these women could have their home and not only that but they came personally to build the a house for each woman, not only did God allowed me to built a house but also to meet great friends and see the love of God for the families.

                    <p>
                        At the beginning of January we received a team from Switzerland from the base of Jucum Wiler, a very incredible and helpful team that left a very high standard because of the heart they had to serve others and share the gospel to all of Mexico, with them we were sharing great moments like going to the streets of Durango to evangelize people, we went to hospitals to distribute food, give a message of encouragement and pray for people, we went to children's dining rooms to spend time with them and also give them food, we were praying for Durango and for people to know more of God.

                        As an organization every Thursday we have ministry day I have the great privilege of being able to go to the men's rehabilitation centers to share with them a message of encouragement, play, talk and praise God with them, it is an incredible time where you can see men being vulnerable, giving their lives to God and wanting to have a change in their lives, that time we have with them is so enjoyable because we can see the joy in their faces as soon as we walk in the door to start and spend time with them.

                <h4>Carnival</h4>
                <p>
                    Every year as an organization we have an outreach crusade in Mazatlan because one of the biggest parties in Mexico is "Carnival" where people come from all over the world to have nights of fun, drink alcohol, do drugs and party so hard they lose themselves, So we take advantage of that week of carnival to go and share God with as many people as we can during that time, we do everything at night we start at 8 pm and end at 12 am we go without fear, loving people as of anything if not loving people as Christ loved us, thank God this year we were able to reach 2 100 people and all of them heard of Christ but also gave their lives to him.

                    <p>
                        In February one of our staff members here in Durango returned home, Raul he is from the Dominican Republic and he is also my brother from another mother, we spent a very nice time with him, we had dinner, we talked, we gave him a few words and we said goodbye, he is a man of God who blessed us a lot with his presence here in Mexico, he was here for two years, I thank God for his life, being obedient and coming to bless my country.

                    <p>
                        As Durango campus we are currently building a hospitality house where we can receive people with the objective that they have their own privacy, feel comfortable, a nice place to spend time and sleep peacefully, thank God we have finished with all the exterior walls of the house, and with the ceilings. It is a bit big because it is two stories so it is more complicated but we are making progress little by little, currently we have already started putting the floor of the second level and we will continue with the electrical part, walls and bathroom.

                <h4>Bibles</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the objectives of our organization YWAM is that every home has a bible so that families can read the word of God, that vision began here in Mexico and we continue to walk in it therefore we as a base in Durango decided to go to a small town that is about an hour and a half from Durango to go and give away bibles to people, The town is called "La villita de San Atenogenes" it is very small but very nice, we were able to deliver about 20 bibles where the people were very open to open the doors of their homes and also the door of their hearts to receive the gospel, some of them gave us water, cookies and cakes.

                    <p>
                        At the beginning of March we had the privilege to join the local church and be part of an incredible medical brigade, where we could see God move greatly in the hearts of the people, many doctors and dentists gave their time to be a blessing to the community of Durango, We were sharing the gospel to each person that came in and that was crazy because we could see children, youth and adults surrendering their lives to Christ, we saw tears, joy and above all people leaving their burdens to God and being completely free, it was a time where the hand of God touched people sometimes just with a word, a hug or a meal.

                    <h4>Harvest</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our campus is a bit far from the city or downtown, we are in an area where our neighbors grow a lot of vegetables to make a living, so we went to one of them to buy vegetables for our base and make food but we also went to offer our help in case they needed something, so it resulted in having a super good time where we could help harvest, learn something new in our lives, build a relationship with our neighbors and also to bless them and be blessed ourselves.
